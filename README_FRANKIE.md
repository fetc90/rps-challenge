Challenge not complete: 

- Need to work on result page so when player clicks rock, the computer plays a move also.
- Will complete by Wednesday 22 May 2019. 

To play the game: 

Fork/clone this project

In the terminal, run bundle to install all the dev dependencies
In the terminal, type rackup to start the server (served on localhost:9292)
Load up http://localhost:9292/ in your browser
